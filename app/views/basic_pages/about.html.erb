  <p> ... and I love to bake! There is no
    question, I am a person that prefers sweet snacks rather than salty ones and
    baking gives me the solution to have sweet treats at home whenever I want.
    Moreover, baking at home offers me the option to select the quality of the
    ingredients I use in my desserts and I can modify each recipe to a healthier
    version with less calories. For example, I always tend to reduce sugar in the
    recipes and I opt for honey instead of sugar. And of course ... baking relaxes me
    and makes my family happy! Who does not like to have healthy delicious desserts
    at home?
    <br><br>
    The recipes here are from my favorite sweets and they are the ones I use when baking.
    Most of them are borrowed, but I always end up modifying a recipe to meet my taste.
    Personally I am not keen of very sweet flavors and I usually crave bitter and sour deserts.
    Therefore I tend to reduce the sugar used in the borrowed recipes. However you will
    always find the reference for the original recipes.

    Most of the photos used in this blog are not taken from me while baking, but
    they are taken from <%= link_to 'Unsplash', 'https://unsplash.com/', target: :_blank %>,
    a great site for freely-usable images. There are few recipes in this blog,
    where the photos are taken from me while baking and I plan to photo shoot
    all the recipes I share with you.

    <br><br>
    I would like to thank all the bakers from who I have borrowed their recipe and
    Unsplash along with all the photographers, who's photos I use in this blog.
    <br><br>
    I hope that you will enjoy the recipes in Bake is Yum and I am looking forward
    for shares and your comments!
