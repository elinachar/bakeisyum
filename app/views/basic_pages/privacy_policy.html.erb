    <li class="section">Cookies
      Our website uses cookies. A cookie is a file containing an identifier (a string of
      letters and numbers) that is sent by a web server to a web browser and is stored
      by the browser. The identifier is then sent back to the server each time the browser
      requests a page from the server. Cookies may be either “persistent” cookies or
      “session” cookies: a persistent cookie will be stored by a web browser and will
      remain valid until its set expiry date, unless deleted by the user before the expiry
      date; a session cookie, on the other hand, will expire at the end of the user session,
      when the web browser is closed. Cookies do not typically contain any information
      that personally identifies a user, but personal information that we store about you
      may be linked to the information stored in and obtained from cookies.
